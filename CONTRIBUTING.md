## 🧑‍💻 Development Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

- Always create a new branch for your feature/fix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
  ```
- Don’t commit directly to `main`.

### Code Style

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for components (e.g., `TodoItem`, `AddTodoForm`).
- Keep components small and reusable.

### Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` → new feature
- `fix:` → bug fix
- `docs:` → documentation changes
- `style:` → formatting (no code changes)
- `refactor:` → code restructuring

### Testing & Validation

- Run the app locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Make sure no console errors or warnings appear.

### Dependencies

- Avoid adding unnecessary npm packages.
- If a new dependency is required, mention it in the PR description.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Add screenshots or descriptions if UI changes are made.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

- Open an Issue
